title: Plugins
---

Rough outline.

Plugins are modules that implement Gatsby APIs. Easily solve common
website build problems. Pull together open source components. For large
complex builds, modularlize customizations into site-specific plugins.

How to use?

Export function for browser/node/ssr. Link to lifecycle APIs doc.

Show several examples of simple plugins (query for them directly â€” add a
utf8 field to typegen-file to pull in utf8 string of file. This would
mean converting this file into a JS component).
